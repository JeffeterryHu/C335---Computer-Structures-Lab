Q1: In previous labs, adding a peripheral has required pin initializations. Why were able to add the nunchuk without initializing anything?

Q2: What are the major differences between these two functions and what does that imply about communicating with the nunchuk?

Q3: What do all of these variables correspond to in the nunchuk?
    
    typedef struct nunchuk_data { 
    	    unsigned char jx;
    	    unsigned char jy;
    	    unsigned short ax;
    	    unsigned short ay;
    	    unsigned short az;
    	    unsigned char c;
    	    unsigned char z;
    } nunchuk_t; 

Q4: Explain the code

    //from f3d_nunchuk_read
    switch (data[5] & 0x03) {
    	   case 2:
    	   	n->z = 1;
    		n->c = 0;
    		break;
    	   case 1:
    	   	n->z = 0;
    		n->c = 1;
    		break;
    	   case 0:
    	   	n->z = 1;
    		n->c = 1;
    		break;
	   case 3:
    	   	n->z = 0;
    		n->c = 0;
    		break;
    }
