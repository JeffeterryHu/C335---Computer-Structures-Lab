Q1: In previous labs, adding a peripheral has required pin initializations. Why were able to add the nunchuk without initializing anything?

	because I2C has been initialized in the lab before

Q2: What are the major differences between these two functions and what does that imply about communicating with the nunchuk?

    the read function has specified either one byte or multiple bytes would be accepted, but the read function does not say that

Q3: What do all of these variables correspond to in the nunchuk?
    
    typedef struct nunchuk_data { 
    	    unsigned char jx;
    	    unsigned char jy;
    	    unsigned short ax;
    	    unsigned short ay;
    	    unsigned short az;
    	    unsigned char c;
    	    unsigned char z;
    } nunchuk_t; 

	it represents the direction of joystick on nunchuk, the x, y, z axis of nunchuk, and also the c & z buttons

Q4: Explain the code

    //from f3d_nunchuk_read
    switch (data[5] & 0x03) {
    	   case 2:
    	   	n->z = 1;
    		n->c = 0;
    		break;
    	   case 1:
    	   	n->z = 0;
    		n->c = 1;
    		break;
    	   case 0:
    	   	n->z = 1;
    		n->c = 1;
    		break;
	   case 3:
    	   	n->z = 0;
    		n->c = 0;
    		break;
    }

	this function will read the data from nunchuk, and giving different cases with different buttons being pressed.

Q5: difficulties and what learned

    at first, I can use user button to change the graphical display with every push, but got stuck at using the nunchuk controlls the display. Also, missing some .o files in Makefile wasted me some time.

    another difficulty is figuring out the correct range for nunchuk buttons and hence I can use the correct logic to use nunchuk buttons control the graphical display.
