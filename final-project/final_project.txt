Description:
  Our game is like a super mario game with jumping over trees.
  We have incorporated all the elements we have learned during the course, LCD, Audio, Nunchuk, and SD card
  LCD will display the game interface.
  A wav file will be played when the game is over.
  Nunchuk c button is implemented in this game as the jump button
  SD card stores the wav file we have modified.
  In order to play the game, we can press either user_btn or Nunchuk C button to make our boy jump.
  During the game, random trees(taller/lower) and clouds will display under same time difference.
