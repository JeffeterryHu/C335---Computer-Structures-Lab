I encountered lots of problems in this lab

First, when I doing the LED slow motion, I was confused about using the systick handler and accidently puts the codes in the main.c, and turns out the interrupts does not exists. Then I found out that all the codes and the flush_uart should both go in the systick handler.

Also, at the beginning, it was hard to understand the queue functions, and the use of enqueue and dequeue confused me. It takes me a lot of time to figure out how the head and tail works for a queue.

Another thing I worked on is improving the LED circle fluency, I used a if statement first, while the i is reseting to -1, the starting led lags little longer than other ones. Then I changed to a single statement of using %, so i is increasing all the time instead of reseting once a while.
