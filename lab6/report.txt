What does the CS pin do (the CS pin is called SS in the lab manual)?
	to enable the device for communication

Why do you set the CS high at the end of the pin initializations? 
What other functions in f3d_gyro.c change CS from low to high or high to low?
	if it is high, we can use the SCLK pin to communication
	f3d_gyro_interface_init()
	f3d_gyro_read(uint8_t* pBuffer, uint8_t ReadAddr, uint16_t NumByteToRead)
	f3d_gyro_write(uint8_t* pBuffer, uint8_t WriteAddr, uint16_t NumByteToWrite)	

How do you hook up multiple peripherals on one SPI bus?
	

The STM has an Operating Frequency of 72 MHz. When initializing SPI1, what do you set the baud rate prescaler to? What is the resulting SPI clock frequency?
	

Does a peripheral (slave) need to be configured with the transmission speed before it can communicate with the microcontroler (master)? Why would you want to be able to do on-the-fly changes in transmission speed?
	becuase it needs to communite with peripheral which has different tranmission speed

Describe what you learned and any difficulties you had:
	we had problems when we doing the user button input. If we get the button works, it only prints off one x axis, or y axis and it is still the problem we haven't solved. Also, light up the leds is a problem, we have if statements with the right logic, but the led light just does not light on as described.
